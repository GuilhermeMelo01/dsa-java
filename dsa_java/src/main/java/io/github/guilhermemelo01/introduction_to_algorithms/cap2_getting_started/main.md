## 2.1 ANALYZING ALGORITHMS

- Worst Case - O(n) (Big-O notation)
  - Describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.


- Average Case - Θ(n) (Big-Theta notation)
  - Describes the tight bound (both upper and lower) of an algorithm 


- Best Case - Ω(n) (Big-Omega Notation)
  - Describes the lower bound of an algorithm's running time.
