# CONCEPTS
``ABOUT AWS``

``POLLY - AI Voice Generator``
- Amazon Polly is a fully-managed service that generates voice on demand, converting any text to 
an audio stream. Using deep learning technologies to convert articles, web pages, PDF documents,
and other text-to-speech (TTS). Polly provides dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages 
for you to build speech-activated applications that engage and convert. Meet diverse linguistic, 
accessibility, and learning needs of users across geographies and markets. Powerful neural networks 
and generative voice engines work in the background, synthesizing speech for you. Integrate the
Amazon Polly API into your existing applications to become voice-ready quickly. 

``LOOSE COUPLING``
- Loose coupling in software development refers to minimizing dependencies between different 
components or modules. This design approach aims to reduce the impact of changes in one component
on others, leading to more flexible, maintainable, and testable code.

``RIGHT SIZING``
- Right sizing is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance
and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost.

``EC2 ALL UPFRONT``
- With the All Upfront option, you pay for the entire Reserved Instance term with one upfront payment.
This option provides you with the largest discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. 

``EC2 PARTIAL UPFRONT``
- With the Partial Upfront option, you make a low upfront payment and are then charged a discounted hourly
rate for the instance for the duration of the Reserved Instance term. The No Upfront option does not
require any upfront payment and provides a discounted hourly rate for the duration of the term.

``AWS CAF``
- O AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) aproveita a experiência e as práticas recomendadas da AWS para
ajudar você na transformação digital e acelerar seus resultados de negócios usando a AWS de forma inovadora.
O AWS CAF identifica recursos organizacionais específicos que sustentam transformações na nuvem bem-sucedidas.
Esses recursos fornecem orientações de práticas recomendadas que ajudam a melhorar sua preparação para a
nuvem. O AWS CAF agrupa seus recursos em seis perspectivas: Negócios, Pessoas, Governança, Plataforma, 
Segurança e Operações. Cada perspectiva abrange um conjunto de recursos que as partes interessadas
relacionadas funcionalmente possuem ou gerenciam na jornada de transformação na nuvem. 
Use o AWS CAF para identificar e priorizar oportunidades de transformação, avaliar e melhorar sua
preparação para a nuvem e desenvolver iterativamente seu roteiro de transformação.

``NAT gateway``
- NAT gateway allows instances in a private subnet to initiate **outbound** connections to the Internet,
while preventing inbound connections.

``AWS Trusted Advisor``
- O AWS Trusted Advisor ajuda você a otimizar custos, aumentar a performance, melhorar a segurança e a resiliência e
operar em grande escala na nuvem. O Trusted Advisor avalia continuamente seu ambiente da AWS usando verificações de
práticas recomendadas entre as categorias de otimização de custos da nuvem, performance, resiliência, segurança,
excelência operacional e limites de serviço, e recomenda ações para remediar todos os desvios em relação às práticas
recomendadas. O Trusted Advisor Priority ajuda os clientes do AWS Enterprise Support a se concentrarem nas
recomendações mais importantes, fornecendo recomendações orientadas pelo contexto e priorizadas de sua equipe 
de contas da AWS.

``Amazon Neptune``
- Amazon Neptune is a managed graph database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's designed to store and 
query billions of relationships with low latency. Neptune supports both property graphs (using Gremlin) and Resource 
Description Framework (RDF) data (using SPARQL). It's used in various applications like knowledge graphs, 
fraud detection, and recommendation engines. 

``AWS Elastic Beanstalk``
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) that simplifies deploying and managing web applications and 
services on AWS. It automates tasks like resource provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling, allowing developers 
to focus on their code. Elastic Beanstalk utilizes AWS services like EC2, S3, and Elastic Load Balancing to create and
manage the environment for your application.

``AWS CloudTrail``
- AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and security monitoring by
logging and monitoring API calls made to every AWS resource in your account. It provides a record of every API call,
including details about the user, account, and source IP address. This information can be used for auditing, 
troubleshooting, and security analysis.

``AWS BUDGET``
- Using AWS Budgets, you can set a budget that alerts you when you exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted
cost or usage amount. You can also set alerts based on your RI or Savings Plans Utilization and Coverage using AWS Budgets.

``AWS STORAGE GATEWAY FILE GATEWAY``
- Nearly all enterprises, regardless of industry, have to store files, whether they are backups, media content, or
files generated by specialized industry applications. Managing and scaling on-premises infrastructure to provide online
storage and distribution of such backup or content files is often burdensome and costly, requiring expensive hardware 
refreshes, data center expansion, and software licensing. These large file data repositories can be siloed in 
specialized file servers or backup systems, limiting access for file sharing, analytics, or media processing.

``AWS ARTIFACT``
- AWS Artifact, available in the console, is a self-service audit artifact retrieval portal that provides our 
customers with on-demand access to AWS’ compliance documentation and AWS agreements.
You can use AWS Artifact Reports **to download AWS security and compliance documents**, such as **AWS ISO certifications**, 
**Payment Card Industry (PCI),** and **System and Organization Control (SOC)** reports.
You can use AWS Artifact Agreements to review, accept, and track the status of AWS agreements such as the Business 
Associate Addendum (BAA).

``AWS CLOUDFORMATION``
- AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows users to model and manage AWS infrastructure resources in an automated and 
secure manner using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It enables users to define their desired infrastructure 
as templates, typically in JSON or YAML format, and then CloudFormation provisions and manages those resources. 
This approach promotes predictability, repeatability, and version control for infrastructure deployments.
